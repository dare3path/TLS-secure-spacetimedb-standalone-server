Subcommands to Modify to add --cert arg(a pub cert to add to internal root store - to be trusted):

Here’s the list with a quick note on what each does and why it needs a server:

    sql.rs
    call.rs: Invokes a reducer—needs server to execute it.
    describe.rs: Fetches database schema—queries the server.
    dns.rs: Manages DNS for a database—updates server config.
    energy.rs: Queries or sets energy usage—hits server metadata (useful even for non-Maincloud resource tracking).
    list.rs: Lists databases—queries server for identity’s databases.
    repl.rs: Interactive SQL/reducer REPL—connects to server for live queries.
    subscribe.rs: Subscribes to query updates—live server connection.
