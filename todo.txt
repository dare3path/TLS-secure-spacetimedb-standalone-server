-------------
----------------
crates in Cargo.toml should probably be moved to workspace so they're same version (when updated) in all places.
check if this is fully done? ^
----------------
add new tests for the modifs that this patch does!
----------------
make sure all manner of 'cargo test' tests pass!
----------------
remove commented out code
----------------
cleanup clearly-not-needed commented out code
----------------
change some added println/eprintln into log::debug! ?
----------------
FIXME: Changing protocol from https to https
----------------
----------------
make sure the args depends on each other properly
----------------
read_file_limited(fixed) and other similar code that isn't in a function(not yet fixed), are both broken
TODO: load_root_cert is still broken
I didn't check the code that grok3 made, tested it superficially though, and it worked.
but now that I looked, it's clear why it worked and why it's incorrect.

----------------
map_request_error!() is kind of a mess to call too
might want an Option<String> (with proper ref) instead of String arg for url, because some errors may happen before even sending the request such as in build_config, thus before .get().send()
----------------
make sure any new anyhow::anyhow!() created errors aren't overwriting existing ones, instead use .context() or .with_context() depending on type.
----------------
still need to check some places like the example client code maybe, to see if it properly returns the error when client certs were required but not provided to a mTLS server (ssl alert 116)
and make sure it goes thru map_request_error
----------------
