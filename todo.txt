-------------
----------------
crates in Cargo.toml should probably be moved to workspace so they're same version (when updated) in all places.
----------------
add new tests for the modifs that this patch does!
----------------
make sure all manner of 'cargo test' tests pass!
----------------
remove commented out code
----------------
cleanup clearly not needed commented out code
----------------
change some added println/eprintln into log::debug! ?
----------------
FIXME: Changing protocol from https to https
----------------
add mTLS (TLS client auth via client certs) - it's done just needs testing (rust client and server seem to work so far, tested)

add it in the main patch! currently it's in ./mTLS.patch
----------------
make sure the args depends on each other properly
----------------
read_file_limited and other similar code that isn't in a function, are both broken
i didn't check the code that grok3 made, tested it superficially though, and it worked
now that I looked, it's clear why it worked and why it's incorrect.

----------------
map_request_error!() is kind of a mess to call too
might want an Option<String> (with proper ref) instead of String arg for url, because some errors may happen before even sending the request such as in build_config, thus before .get().send()
----------------
make sure any new anyhow::anyhow!() created errors aren't overwriting existing ones, instead use .context() or .with_context() depending on type.
